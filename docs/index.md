## Overview

[FunFact](https://github.com/yhtang/FunFact.git) is a Python package that enables flexible and concise expressions of tensor algebra through an Einstein notation-based syntax. A particular emphasis is on automating the design of matrix and tensor factorization models.  Itâ€™s areas of applications include quantum circuit synthesis, tensor decomposition, and neural network compression. It is GPU- and parallelization-ready thanks to modern numerical linear algebra backends such as JAX/TensorFlow and PyTorch.
<!-- To this end, it leverages randomized combinatorial optimization and stochastic gradient-based methods. -->
